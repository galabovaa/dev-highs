Release Version 1.0

Release versions will be changed manually from the HiGHS/CMakeLists.txt for the moment.

This set of documents serves as internal specification complimenting the source code along with the highs-docsy for public documentation (see section Documentation below) for the official HiGHS 1.0 resease.

See design-doc.md for the general structure and the design docs in the subfolders for component details.
